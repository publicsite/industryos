Industry OS is a GNU/Linux based distribution, designed for industry, with a focus on R&D.

It includes:
	* Debian packages, including various meta-packages such as;
		* Chemistry
		* Medical
		* Geographic
		* Mathematic
		* And those relating to other Sciences.

	* LinuxCNC packages for numerical control of CNC machines (and ...)

	* Toxic hazard estimation

It uses XFCE as it's desktop environment so should be rather speedy and easy to use.

To build an live iso, from a debian-based machine, clone the repository and run
	./stage1.sh

Code may need some minor tweaking to work.
